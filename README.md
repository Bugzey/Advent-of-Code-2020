#	Advent of Code 2020
##	Description
This is my entry for the 2020 edition of the infamous Advent of Code series of programming
challenges. Each day between 1. Dec and 25. Dec a new challenge is posted on the website
(https://adventofcode.com/2020/). Each puzzle consists of two parts, the second of which unlocks
after the first one is successfully completed.

##	Installation
Clone this repository via `git clone`. A setuptools installation config might be added in the
future.

##	Usage
The project is structured as an overarching namespace package `aoc2020` whose subpackages correspond
to the individual days of the programming challenge. Separate packages aim to work as standalone CLI
applications, each one having its own documentation and docstring.
